//Parity

/*
Check the following program that shows even numbers (divisible by 2) between 1 and 10.

for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  if (i % 2 === 0) {
    console.log(`${i} is even`);
  }
}
This program uses the modulo operator %, which calculates the remainder after division of one number by another. It's often used to assess number parity.

console.log(10 % 2); // 0 because 10 = 5 * 2 + 0
console.log(11 % 2); // 1 because 11 = 5 * 2 + 1
console.log(18 % 3); // 0 because 18 = 3 * 6 + 0
console.log(19 % 3); // 1 because 19 = 3 * 6 + 1
console.log(20 % 3); // 2 because 20 = 3 * 6 + 2
