/*
Add a function to our code findStudent(keyword) that matches all students in the students array whose lowercased name includes the lowercased keyword, and print a formatted string based on the number of matches as described below.

If one student matches the keyword, print the string <student> is enrolled.. If more than one student matches the keyword, print the string Multiple students match this keyword.. If zero students match the keyword, print the string No students match this keyword..
Note: The match should not be case sensitive. The keyword a should match the student Alec and the keyword A should match the student Sarah.
